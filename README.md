Derive insights for targeted marketing strategy

## Project Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. They want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better targeted marketing.

## Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
    ● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
      often do they return to Instacart)?
    ● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    ● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    ● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
      Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
