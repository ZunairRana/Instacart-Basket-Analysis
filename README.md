# Instacart-Basket-Analysis
Derive insights using Python for targeted marketing strategy (careerfoundry Data Analytics course)

## Project Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. They want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better targeted marketing.

## Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

## Data
Used open-source data sets from Instacart:
- Customers Data Set
- Data Dictionary
